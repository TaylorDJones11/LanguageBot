## Steps to Build the Bot üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª

1. **Create an Empty Chatbot**  
   Begin by creating a new bot in Amazon Lex with a basic configuration.

   - Define user intents, like `TranslateIntent`, to manage translation requests.
   - Add slots to capture details, such as the target language.

3. **Specify Fulfillment**  
   Set up fulfillment to manage how Lex responds, using AWS Lambda to handle the request and Amazon Translate for translation.

4. **Create an IAM Role**  
   Set up an IAM role with permissions for Amazon Lex, Lambda, and Translate to enable secure service access.

5. **Create a Lambda Function**  
   Develop a Lambda function to process the translation request by interacting with the Amazon Translate API.

6. **Test the Lambda Function**  
   Verify the Lambda function works as expected by running test cases with sample phrases.

7. **Test the Chatbot**  
   Integrate and test the bot in the Amazon Lex console, checking for correct translations.
